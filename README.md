 - added toString() to Bike class.
 
 - change BikeList to Static (so that other class and their methods can acsses bike list without taking BikeList as argument or 
call constructor for BikeList).

 - minor change in BikeProvider class because BikeList become static (register method has no BikeList argument, some "list bike" instance is replaced by "BikeList.getBikes").
 
 - changed searchBike() to static method for Quote class, and argument "Bikelist bikes" is removed because 
 now it can directly access to BikeList. In addition, it will return List<Bike> which size is <= Condition.getNumber().
                                                                                                                      
 - Added partially implemented Customer class (**bookQuote method is not yet implemented**).
 
**Note**  
Since our getQuote() should return Collection<Quote>, I implemented getQuote() as:
 ```
 public Collection<Quote> getQuote(Condition c){
       List <Quote> quotes = new ArrayList<>();
       List <Bike> results = Quote.searchBike(c);
       for (Bike b: results) {
           quotes.add(new Quote(b,b.getPrice()));
       }
       return quotes;
    }
 ```
However, I think this is little bit weird.  
 
Personally I feel like we can remove searchBike() form Quote class and implement that process in the getQuote() in Customer class.
And use Quote class just for Wrapper Class of Bike.  

If you feel like same, we can change these part of our plan.

added Account class

updated BikeProvider so that it extends Account class as shown in our class diagram

Note: Each Quote should contain a Bike class and getQuotes() in Customer class should return a list of Quote, as stated in CW3_instruction. Our searchBike() method in Quote class might be wrong, we might need to do what searchBike does in getQuotes(), and then wrap the list of Bike as list of Quote.

CW3 said **"Do not alter the provided DeliveryService, Deliverable interfaces, or the DeliveryService-
Factory and MockDeliveryService classes."** so marked them as completed.

In addition we need usecase test for each usecase in CW3.

**11/21:Min**

simplify overlap() in class DateRange

added price range in class Condition

updated class diagram

Uploaded in "Class and Test".
 - [x] Location.java, 
 - [x] TestLocation.java, 
 - [x] DateRange.java, 
 - [x] TestDateRange.java, 
 - [ ] Condition.java  

â€»There are several change from class diagram.  
 1. Data -> DataRange with additional methods as it is instructed in CW3.
 2. In the Condition class, some datatype is changed. type:BikeType, price:BigDecimal, date:DateRange.
