added Account class

updated BikeProvider so that it extends Account class as shown in our class diagram

Note: Each Quote should contain a Bike class and getQuotes() in Customer class should return a list of Quote, as stated in CW3_instruction. Our searchBike() method in Quote class might be wrong, we might need to do what searchBike does in getQuotes(), and then wrap the list of Bike as list of Quote.

CW3 said **"Do not alter the provided DeliveryService, Deliverable interfaces, or the DeliveryService-
Factory and MockDeliveryService classes."** so marked them as completed.

In addition we need usecase test for each usecase in CW3.
